These from a Reading comprehension,I think they are beautiful.Something can tuch me.
> For a long time it had seemed to me that life was about to begin–real life. But there was always some obstacle in the way,something to be gotten through first,some unfinished business,time still to be served,At last it dawned on me that these obstacles were my life.

>So stop waiting until you finish school,until you go back to school;until you get married,until you get divorced;until you have kids;until you recite;until you get a new car or house;until spring;until you are born again to decide that there is no better time than right now to be happy.

>So,Work like you don’t need money,love like you have never been hurt,and dance like no one’s waching.


I want to be a person like this.

# THE WEEKEND #
Do you have weekends?Maybe you think it’s a silly question.But,what I want to say is “We don’t”.We have “Big Weekend” and “Small Weekend”.What are them?Our school makes two weeks(14 days) as a “Big Weekend” .And a week(7 days) as a “Small Weekend”.They are not the same things.Every “Small Weekend” we need to have 7 days class and during this week we are not admitted to have a weekend.On the sundays afternoon,we have a small rest which is “Small Weekend”.The “Small Weekend” is from 12:10 to 5:00.And if some students’s home is far from the school,they can’t go home for not being late for school.So they have to stay at scool for 12 days for waiting a “Big Weekend”.The “Big Weekend” is a week after the “Small Weekend”.During the “Big Weekend”,we have 5 days class.It seems like a normal week.On the end of the “Big Weekend”,the fridays noon,we can leave school and have a two days rest.(Sounds like two days,but we should back school at sundays afternoon).That’s our “WEEKEND”.
# OUR TIMETABLE #
When we are at school,we need to get up at 5:20 for not being late for the morning reciting class at 5:35.After the class,we will go to running exercise or sometime the weather isn’t well we will go to eat breakfast.It’s about 6:30.I think it is too early.We have five classes in the morning.Every class is 40 minutes.At 12:10,we can have lunch.From the breakfast to the lunch,it’s five more hours.I think it’s very unhealthy and during the class I always feel hungry.After the lunch,we have a noon rest.(Too much homework make us can only sleep a little time).We have four classes in the afternoon,then we eat dinner.In the evening,we have three classes until 10:00.That’s our one day.
# THE HOMEWORK #
More and more,can’t finished.I don’t think it’s a good way to study.I want to do my homework quietly,but I can’t because of so much home work.I always feel hurry.I really want to have some time to learn something by heart but the homework make me so embarrassed.We need to do homework but not so much.I really want to know every teachers know what is “small gathered to big”.Every teacher say that they don’t give us too much homework and why we can’t finish it.But do you know,we don’t learn one subject.All teachers’s thought like this,but don’t know what our feeling is.
# MORE BAD #
There are much thing that I don’t want to write.What’s your high school life is?
Why our school only want to let us get a good grades and not care about other subject.

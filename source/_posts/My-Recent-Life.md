Long time no write blog.

# I failed the CET 6

That's a little sad. But I deserve it. Because I did not review it,  even not recite words or do a test. To be honest, I think that the America drama will help me pass the test, but not. And the listening part let me feel bad. It seems that I know what he is speaking but I don't know which one is the correct . The America drama made my listening ability level up, I can feel it. But to deal with the test, I still need to practice.

All in all, the laziness is the reason. I like English, I want to do well in it. But the learning process is a little boring, the word, the language grammar and so on.

# The study

There are some courses I don't like and some I like. The bad news is that the dislikes more than likes. I told myself don't care it. I had study 12 years, the all things I had studied were all I liked? Definitely not. So don't be sad about the major. 

I often think that even if I live in the life I want this moment, what will I feel a week later, a month later? Will I am happy for so long? No. I will always longing the better life and never satisfied.

# The Domain Name

I got the Domain Name [yinyuwei.com](http://yinyuwei.com/) recently. You ask me why? Having a website always makes me happy. The website is about her make me more happy. Maybe there are some other reasons. But I could not know so clearly. I think it's hard to express in even Chinese. So just leave it my heart and my mind.

# Something other

The experiment. The college innovative item. The reading book. The seeing movie. The grades. And so on, just let me crazy.

Maybe I should write blog more often. The writing of above is not fluent.
